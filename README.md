# Assignment 1

This repository contains two Python scripts for the first assignment.

## Task 1: Number Calculations (`assignment-1_task-1.py`)

This Python program prompts the user to enter two numbers. It then performs several calculations using these numbers and displays the results to the user. The specific calculations likely include basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Task 2: Personalized Greeting (`assignment-1-task-2.py`)

This Python program takes the user's first name and last name as input. It then concatenates these two strings to create a full name. Finally, the program prints a personalized greeting message that includes the user's full name.
